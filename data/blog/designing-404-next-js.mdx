You've most likely experienced this before: you click on a link, and Boom! 404, page not found!
The feeling can be quite annoying, but if you're developping a website, your users will most likely
land there anyway. So why not make the most of it?

Here's what we're going to be building:

<SoloImage
image="designing-404-next-js-preview.png"
alt="Preview"
dimensions={450}
/>

A very simple way of telling our users they shouldn't be here. The cursor will act as a flashlight 
and we'll have a simple button redirecting us to our previous location. Let's get into it!

<Section title="Introduction to radial gradients" id="Introduction to radial gradients"/>

I'm sure you've heard of linear-gradients before.

<Section title="Getting set up" id="Getting set up"/>

Under the <FolderText text="pages"/> folder, create a new file called <FolderText text="404.js"/>.

<TipBlue title="Dealing with error 500">
    Next.js also provides a custom 500 page defined in the file <FolderText text="_error.js"/>.
    The idea is the pretty much the same, but I won't be covering it.

<Subsection title="My small section" id="id1"/>

<Codepen 
_HTML={
`<div>
    hello
</div>`}
_CSS={
`.x {
    font-size: 45px;
}`}
_JS={
`function add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}`}
/>


<JavaScript>
{`import "../styles/_queries.css";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
	return (
