You've most likely experienced this before: you click on a link, and Boom! 404, page not found!
The feeling can be quite annoying, but if you're developping a website, your users will most likely
land there anyway. So why not make the most of it?

Here's what we're going to be building:

<SoloImage
image="designing-404-next-js-preview.png"
alt="Preview"
dimensions={450}
/>

A very simple way of telling our users they shouldn't be here. The cursor will act as a flashlight 
and we'll have a simple button redirecting us to our previous location. Let's get into it!

<Section title="Introduction to radial-gradients" id="Introduction to radial-gradients"/>

I'm sure you've heard of linear-gradients before. They're defined by at least two colors and a 
direction as first argument <i>(which is optional)</i>. Let's generate a simple gradient that starts from the bottom left corner
with three colors: red, yellow and blue.

<Codepen 
_HTML={
`<div></div>`}
_CSS={
`div {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, red, yellow, blue);
}`}
_initial="CSS"
/>

If no direction is specified, the default transition is top to bottom. All of this
is great, but let's take it to the next level. What if we want our gradient to start from the center?
That's where radial-gradients come in. At the minimum, a radial-gradient is defined by:

<Options>
    <li><b>Shape</b>: an ellipse or a circle</li>
    <li><b>Colors</b>: at least two colors</li>
</Options>

<Codepen 
_HTML={
`<div></div>`}
_CSS={
`div {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: radial-gradient(circle, blue 30px, red 100px);
}`}
_initial="CSS"
/>

I won't get into details since there are many things you can do with radial-gradients. 
And all you have to know for this tutorial is that they exist because we'll need them soon.
But if you want to learn more, <Lk url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/css/gradient/radial-gradient#syntax">here's a good reference</Lk>.

<Subsection title="Getting set up" id="Getting set up"/>

Let's actually start now. Under the <FolderText text="pages"/> folder, create a new file called <FolderText text="404.js"/>.
Anytime a user will land on a non-existent page, our 404 page will be rendered.


<TipBlue title="Dealing with error 500">
    If you want to deal with error 500, Next.js also provides a custom 500 page 
    defined in the file <FolderText text="500.js"/>.
