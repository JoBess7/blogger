You've most likely experienced this before: you click on a link, and Boom! 404, page not found!
The feeling can be quite annoying, but if you're developping a website, your users will most likely
land there anyway. So why not make the most of it?

Here's what we're going to be building:

<SoloImage
image="designing-404-next-js-preview.png"
alt="Preview"
dimensions={450}
/>

A very simple way of telling our users they shouldn't be here. The cursor will act as a flashlight 
and we'll have a simple button redirecting us to our previous location. Let's get into it!

<Section title="Introduction to radial gradients" id="Introduction to radial gradients"/>

I'm sure you've heard of linear-gradients before. They're defined by at least two colors and a 
direction as first argument <i>(which is optional)</i>. Let's generate a simple gradient that starts from the bottom left corner
with three colors: red, yellow and blue.

<Codepen 
_HTML={
`<div></div>`}
_CSS={
`div {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, red, yellow, blue);
}`}
_initial="CSS"
/>

If no direction is specified, the default transition is top to bottom. All of this
is great, but let's take it to the next level. What if we want our gradient to start from the center?
That's where radial-gradients come in. A radial-gradient is defined by:

<Options>
    <li><b>Shape</b>: an ellipse or a circle</li>
    <li><b>Colors</b>: at least two colors</li>
</Options>

<Codepen 
_HTML={
`<div></div>`}
_CSS={
`div {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: radial-gradient(circle farthest-side, #fceabb, #f8b500);
}`}
_initial="CSS"
/>


<Section title="Getting set up" id="Getting set up"/>

Under the <FolderText text="pages"/> folder, create a new file called <FolderText text="404.js"/>.

<TipBlue title="Dealing with error 500">
    Next.js also provides a custom 500 page defined in the file <FolderText text="_error.js"/>.
    The idea is the pretty much the same, but I won't be covering it.
