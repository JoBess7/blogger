You've most likely experienced this before: you click on a link, and Boom! 404, page not found!
The feeling can be quite annoying, but if users will land there anyway, why not make the most of it?

<TipBlue title="404 page with Next.js">
    This website is built with Next.js. If you're using it too,
    you can simply create a new file called<it> _error.js </it>
    under the <it>pages</it> folder and customize it all you want.
