I built GitHubSpy back in 2021 when I was getting started with <Lk url="https://nextjs.org/">next.js</Lk>. Essentially,
it offers a much nicer look of your GitHub statistics. Just enter your GitHub 
username <Lk url="https://githubspy.vercel.app/">here</Lk>. You'll be shown your 
top languages, most starred repositories, and much more!

<TipBlue title="Incompatibility with a few GitHub accounts">
    The code fetches from more than 4 APIs. Unfortunately, some of these APIs
    can't fetch data from all users. This is why you might get an error when
    looking for your account!
